# IrisFlowerClassification
My approach on the classic Iris Classification Problem using Pandas, Matplotlib, and SKLearn. 

# Technology and Notes
Built using SKLearn's metrics and linear models. 
I made an effort to document the iPython Notebook well in the event that future users wanted to use my project as a guide.
